

The smooth white curve of something cold is beauty and indifference in a staring match.


Careful lines of liminality are hewn here, in this fine thing that was once a thing called marble. And forced within yet perhaps more likely from without, is that once singular moment, when Daphne blinked. 
The sprouting of ten fingertips like footnotes to Diana, lean into the anitiquiti-morphic notion that this here moment, is meaning distilled. 
And with a deep breath that somehow meant the female form and the trees and the water and the earth...

A male hand grasped the belly/womb and in that one singular moment, Daphne blinked. Its not so much the form, that is terror made stone on her face, but rather the forced supplication to its passive fertility. 


The cruel form of one laurel tree held on the eternal head of a male god is the Olympian price for willful evasion. Spent wisely over the course of a testo-fueled trajectory, each branch became a freshly plucked wreath bearing the weight of one quixotic marble nymph. 


Consolation prize, would take the lofty form of symbolism copy written by a father, owned by a husband, and inherited to a son. To Daphne and her daughters the image of a blooming branch. Poised in its immobility, valuable in its supplication, and lauded by the aching loins of one thousand lonely poets. Yet for all its fertile potency, another smooth white curve, fixed / cold -

at the chiseling hand of a son.
