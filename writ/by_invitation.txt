The smooth white curve of something cold 
is beauty and indifference 
in a staring match.

Careful lines of liminality are hewn here in this fine thing that was once 
just called marble. 

And forced upon it 
yet perhaps more likely from without 
is that one singular moment
when Daphne blinked. 

The sprouting of ten fingertips 
like footnotes to Ovid, lean into
the marble aged notion of antiquity
which declares that this here moment 
is meaning distilled. 

And with a deep breath that somehow meant the female form 
and the trees 
and the water 
and the earth...

One quixotic nymph is fixed into a form 
less complicated than her own body. 

To Daphne and all daughters: 
the image of a blooming branch. 
Poised in immobility 
valuable in its supplication
and lauded by the aching loins 
of one thousand lonely poets. 

To Apollo and all sons:
the weight of a laurel wreath
placed in triumphant commemoration
of that one singular moment 

when Daphne blinked.
